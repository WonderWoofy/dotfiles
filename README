-WonderWoofy's dotfiles-

This serves as version control for my personal configuration files.
I am new to github, so if you somehow found yourself here, bear with me.

In the event that you did accidently find yourself here, have at it!
If anything is of use to you, great.  If you find something I have done
wrong, I'd love to hear about it.
